Summary 
---------
Computes the Fast Fourier Transform with 2\ :sup:`N` channels for time
samples presented 2\ :sup:`P` at a time in parallel. Uses a biplex FFT
architecture under the hood which has been extended to handled time
samples in parallel. For P = 0, this block accepts two independent,
parallel streams (labelled as pols) and computes the FFT of each
independently (the biplex architecture provides this for free). Data is
output in normal frequency order, meaning that channel 0 (corresponding
to DC) is output first, followed by channel 1, on up to channel
2\ :sup:`N` âˆ’ 1 (which can be interpreted as channel -1). When
multiple time samples are presented in parallel on the input, multiple
frequency samples are output in parallel.

Description 
-------------
Computes the Fast Fourier Transform with 2\ :sup:`N` channels for time
samples presented 2\ :sup:`P` at a time in parallel. Uses a biplex FFT
architecture under the hood which has been extended to handled time
samples in parallel. For P = 0, this block accepts two independent,
parallel streams (labelled as pols) and computes the FFT of each
independently (the biplex architecture provides this for free). Data is
output in normal frequency order, meaning that channel 0 (corresponding
to DC) is output first, followed by channel 1, on up to channel
2\ :sup:`N` âˆ’ 1 (which can be interpreted as channel -1). When
multiple time samples are presented in parallel on the input, multiple
frequency samples are output in parallel.
