% Performs various munges on a block.
%
% munge_block(blk,varargin)
%
% blk - The block whose mask will be dumbed down or turned off
% varargin - A cell array of strings indicating the munges to do.
%
% Supported munges:
%
% 'dumbdown'
%
%   Dumbing down a block's mask makes the block's mask informative only;
%   the mask can no longer be used to configure the subsystem.  Here is
%   a list of what happens to a mask that is dumbed down...
%
%   o MaskInitialization code is deleted.
%   o All mask parameters are marked as disabled, non-tunable, and
%     do-not-evaluate. 
%
% 'unmask'
%
%   Turns off the block's mask.
